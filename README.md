## 📂 Project Structure

 The app is organized into clean modules to ensure scalability:

## 📱 Code Highlight

Using Swift's modern `Date` formatting API for localization-friendly displays:

```swift
// Automatically formats the date based on the user's locale
Text(Date().formatted(date: .long, time: .omitted))
    .font(.subheadline)
    .foregroundColor(.secondary)
